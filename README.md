Asp.Net Unique Architecture  AUA is a simple, lightweight framework for producing projects of any size (small and large). It can be applied in all architectures (Micro service, CQRS, etc.) due to its transparency in structure. It is also full of different design patterns, thus a great source for software architects and developers.
